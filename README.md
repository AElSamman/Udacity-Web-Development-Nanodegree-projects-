# Landing Page Project

## Development Strategy

First things first, I started by linking my app.js to the index.html

Secondly, I did build out my HTML with more than 3 sections. Additional sections were added to the HTML document in order to test the performance.

Third, A navigation menu is automatically built based on the number of sections the landing page contains using javascript.

Also, There is a functionality to distinguish the section in view which display it with black background. An active state was added to the navigation items when a section is in the viewport.

Moreover, the project includes a smooth scroll to sections when using the navigation menu .

Finally, the code was refactored more than once for optimization and clean performance.
